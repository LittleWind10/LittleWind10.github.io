			'Introducing Achord.ly, a musical community rooted in Bandung since 2017. Born from a passion for music, Achord.ly offers a unique space for musicians and enthusiasts to hone their skills, exchange ideas, and share their love for playing instruments. Over the years, this community has thrived, attracting an ever-growing number of music aficionados, united by a common goal of musical improvement and connection.',
		projectBackground:
			"In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the year-end meeting of Achord.ly members sparked an innovative idea. Recognizing that aspiring musicians from far beyond Bandung's borders desired to be part of the Achord.ly community to refine their musical talents, it became evident that a digital platform was needed. However, the pandemic restricted the community from accepting members from distant locations. This predicament led to the proposal of creating a digital platform that would transcend geographical boundaries and enable music enthusiasts from all corners of Indonesia to sharpen their musical abilities. As the initial step, the focus will be on developing a mobile application for Android and iOS operating systems, aptly named Achord.ly. This application, in essence, will serve as a reservoir for chords, offering users a vast library of chord progressions for their favorite songs, complemented by instructional video tutorials on how to play them.",
